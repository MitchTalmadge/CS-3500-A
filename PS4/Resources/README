This assignment was very confusing at first, but I'm pretty sure I got it worked out.
I decided not to add WriteXml/ReadXml methods in Cell because I opted not to include a "Name" field in Cell, 
and so it made no sense for the cell to read in its name when it does not even have a name... If ya catch my drift. 
It would have been overly complicated, since I'd have to return the name, and that is pointless when spreadsheet can just 
read the name itself.

My initial design thoughts for this project were to use a Dictionary to map names to cells. I started creating a Cell class and decided
not to add a name field since it was already in the Dictionary, and felt redundant / wasteful. When implementing the dependency-finding
methods, I started by using a for loop that traversed the Dictionary, then realized that I had done all that in PS2. After adding the
DependencyGraph and creating helper methods, it all came together.

The versions of PS2 and PS3 I am using are those from commit 0fcc3596 at 9/25/2017 7:08:30 AM
